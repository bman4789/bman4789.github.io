      "content_html": "<p>When migrating my site from Jekyll on GitHub Pages to Eleventy on GitHub Pages, I wanted to continue to use my page redirects to preserve old links.</p>\n<p>Caveat: Emitting new HTML files with redirect content is best for webservers that just serve files. Hosts like <a href=\"https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/\">Netlify</a>, <a href=\"https://vercel.com/docs/configuration#project/redirects\">Vercel</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/redirects.html\">AWS Amplify</a>, or your own webserver all offer ways to centrally configure redirects. Using your host or webserver to configure redirects is probably a better approach that serving redirect HTML files that are handled on the client side.</p>\n<h2 id=\"backstory\">Backstory <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#backstory\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span>#</a></h2>\n<p>GitHub Pages supports automatically building a Jekyll site when we commit to the target branch. There are a <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/versions/\">collection of plugins</a> that we can use on top of base Jekyll installation. One of these is <a href=\"https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-redirect-from\">jekyll-redirect-from</a>. This lets us specify pages/routes to redirect from, to the current page.</p>\n<p>Let's say we have a page with the following front-matter. This will emit a page at <code>/new-page.html</code>.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-yaml\"><code class=\"language-yaml\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">---</span><br><span class=\"token key atrule\">title</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> My Cool Page<br><span class=\"token key atrule\">permalink</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> /new<span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span>page<br><span class=\"token key atrule\">redirect_from</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> /old<span class=\"token punctuation\">-</span>page<br><span class=\"token punctuation\">---</span><br></code></pre>\n<p>With the <code>jekyll-redirect-from</code> plugin, it will also emit a page at <code>/old-page.html</code>, with the following content.

Kick back, relax, and read all I have to tell you about me this year <span aria-label=\"male information desk person\" class=\"emoji\" role=\"img\">💁🏻‍♂️</span></p>\n<p>This year started off with probably one of the busiest months I've had in years, and progressed to the months just blurring by. Thankfully I've remained COVID-19 free, which has certainly been a highlight of the year.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.brianm.me/images/posts/2020-review/2020.jpg\" alt=\"Posing in front of a giant 2020 sign\">\n  <figcaption>The year started off so well, and with so much hope (Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>COVID-19 has always lurked at and shaped pretty much every part of the year. I don't think I went more than an hour or two without ever directly thinking about something related to COVID-19. I'm trying to keep this post mostly positive, but know that I've struggled with living alone, not able to see others, having to cancel plans, and staying motivated. Social distancing and wearing face masks are relatively easy to do, and are so effective in reducing the spread of the virus, I take some comfort in that it's actively helping to save lives. I just hope more people would do the same.</p>\n<p>This summer was a rough time, particularly in Minneapolis after the killing of George Floyd by the Minneapolis Police Department. South Minneapolis heard helicopters flying overhead for most of the summer, had stores boarded up for weeks,\nand fought for what has unfortunately amounted in little change in fighting racism in the MPD.</p>\n<p>The last six months have been a blur, and I'm having a hard time coming up with any notable events to highlight. Lots of the same, what's one month from another.</p>\n<p>For the fourth full year, I've recorded a compilation of the year with <a href=\"https://1se.co\">1 Second Every Day</a>. I swear this makes my year look a lot more interesting than I feel it was. This year it's a little easier to see through the guise at how much of the same there was. Sorry about the overwhelming amount of clips there are at Lake of the Isles...</p>\n<figure class=\"video-container\">\n  <div>\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DXL2znYQ0f4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>\n  <figcaption>1 Second Every Day 2020</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"lighting-design\">Lighting Design <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#lighting-design\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span>#</a></h2>\n<p>I started the year with tech week as lighting designer for Young Artists Initiative's Frozen Jr. I somehow managed to pull some ridiculous hours and worked remotely for my day job from my parents' house from 05:00 until the early afternoon when I went to the theater and worked until 22:00. The show was a huge success, a ton of fun to design for, and had a wonderful production staff that I had the pleasure of working with! I spent a lot of time inventorying, testing, and experimenting with some new-to-the-company intelligent fixtures. They were old, but the ones that worked, worked great and let me add a whole new dimension of colors and movement into the show.</p>\n<h2 id=\"vietnam-trip\">Vietnam Trip <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#vietnam-trip\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span>#</a></h2>\n<p>Less than a week after the show closed I was in the air flying to Vietnam. It was a 12-hour flight to Seoul, South Korea, a four-hour layover, and then a 5.5 hour flight to Ho Chi Minh City, where we landed around 22:00 to something like 85ºF and super humid weather. It took a few days to work through the jet lag, but it was also fun to wake up at 05:00 and get out into the city as everyone was waking up (and it was a lot cooler).</p>\n<p>We spent a few days in Ho Chi Minh City, then flew north to Da Nang, and then ended in Hanoi during the lunar new year. Vietnam is beautiful and full of truly incredible food (oh my god, the food was so good <span aria-label=\"drooling face\" class=\"emoji\" role=\"img\">🤤</span>). It was interesting to learn about the differences of the food, culture, and history from the southern to the northern parts of the country. I'm so happy for my coworkers (hi Kim and Jenn!) who were fantastic guides for finding food, getting around, having ideas of places to see, and reading signs and talking to people. It was fun to get to know some friends of Jenn who joined the group as well!</p>\n<div class=\"grid-thumbs\">\n  <figure>\n    <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.brianm.me/images/posts/2020-review/train-tracks.jpg\" alt=\"Train street in Hanoi, Vietnam\">\n    <figcaption>Train Street in Hanoi, Vietnam</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure>\n    <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.brianm.me/images/posts/2020-review/pho.jpg\" alt=\"Pho\">\n    <figcaption>Phở</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n<p>This was my first time to Asia and I cannot wait to go back!

I think there were two cases in Vietnam when we left. The joke's on us though, Vietnam handled it so much better than the US did.</p>\n<p>February was pretty good, aside from the looming COVID-19 news. I even had a nice gathering of friends and family at HeadFlyer Brewing towards the end of the month for my birthday. This turned out to be my largest social event of the year <span aria-label=\"goofy face\" class=\"emoji\" role=\"img\">🤪</span>.</p>\n<p>The weekend before starting to work remotely in mid-March, I got a haircut, hugged my parents (the last hug I've had this whole year <span aria-label=\"sad pensive face\" class=\"emoji\" role=\"img\">😔</span>), walked around Bde Maka Ska in Minneapolis, and bought a case of Corona beer. Life has pretty much continued for me with the same mindset as I had back then. Wearing a face mask everywhere outside my apartment (unless I'm biking outside, or walking at night when no one else is out) sure makes me miss having TouchID on my iPhone!</p>\n<h3 id=\"personal-growth\">Personal Growth <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#personal-growth\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span>#</a></h3>\n<p>With locking down for the rest of the year, I had a lot more time and drive to focus on myself a bit. One notable highlight is how little I drove my car and instead walked or biked to where I needed to go. I let it go a full month without even turning it on, twice this year.</p>\n<h4 id=\"moving-apartments\">Moving Apartments <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#moving-apartments\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span>#</a></h4>\n<p>At the end of June I said goodbye to my roommate and 2-bedroom apartment I had been living in for 2.5 years and moved 200ft (ca. 61 m) away to the next building over and into a 1-bedroom. It's been great having a place to myself and was a good time to upgrade and purchase some new furniture.</p>\n<p>Living alone has been mostly alright, but it definitely gets lonely sometimes. I stay socially active through video calls and some masked walks with friends outdoors. It's not the same, but I'll take what I can get.</p>\n<h4 id=\"physical-health\">Physical Health <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#physical-health\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span>#</a></h4>\n<p>I increased the move goal on my Apple Watch and spent a lot of time walking and biking this year.

Especially in the late summer and fall, I worked hard on clearing the fog on every street in South Minneapolis in Fog of World. I'm not done yet, but I did finish a huge amount of it. Maybe next year I'll clear west of the chain of lakes and the neighborhoods south of Minnehaha Creek. Biking up and down streets isn't the highest speed biking, but it sure is interesting!</p>\n<div class=\"grid-thumbs\">\n  <figure>\n    <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.brianm.me/images/posts/2020-review/biking.jpg\" alt=\"Selfie of biking with my roommate\">\n    <figcaption>Biking in Carver Park Reserve</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure>\n    <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.brianm.me/images/posts/2020-review/FoW-mpls.jpg\" alt=\"Fog of World Minneapolis\">\n    <figcaption>Fog of World exploration in Minneapolis</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n<p>Through increased physical activity, eating more healthily, and drinking less alcohol, I've lost 20 pounds (ca. 9 kg) this year.

Now that I'm working from home, I had a reason to actually make coffee at home. At the start of the year, I just had a Mr. Coffee automatic drip brewer. Now I've added a burr grinder, Aeropress, moka pot, Bee Hive pour-over, a milk frother, and a cold brew pitcher. It's been a fun and tasty year in terms of coffee!</p>\n<h4 id=\"cooking\">Cooking <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#cooking\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span>#</a></h4>\n<p>Kind of related to coffee, at least in the sense that it takes place in the kitchen, I've been cooking a lot more this year. While some may find this appalling, last weekend I even bought my own bag of flour for the first time and actually make dough from scratch to make æbleskiver. Beyond that, I've been cooking proper meals a lot more than before mid-March. I mostly stick to vegetarian meals, I like to fry or steam various vegetables and serve with some sort of sauce on pasta or rice (wow Brian, that was such a generic description). Last winter I bought a pizza stone, which has been a delicious and fun adventure to cook with!</p>\n<p>With working from home, making lunch is a lot easier and less annoying than preparing a bagged lunch was. I can make a fresh sandwich that has tomato and doesn't get soggy too! <span aria-label=\"grinning face with squinting eyes\" class=\"emoji\" role=\"img\">😄</span> Pro tip, when making a sandwich with cheese, after you toast your bread, put mustard on one slice, and mayonnaise on the other. Take the mayonnaise slice and put your cheese on that, then put back in your toaster oven (the best kitchen appliance) and broil it for a minute or two to fully melt the cheese. It takes just enough time to put the rest of your sandwich together and gives you a melty and delicious hot sandwich!</p>\n<div class=\"grid-thumbs\">\n  <figure>\n    <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.brianm.me/images/posts/2020-review/pizza.jpg\" alt=\"Homemade pizza\">\n    <figcaption>Pizza</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure>\n    <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.brianm.me/images/posts/2020-review/bibimbap.jpg\" alt=\"Bibimbap\">\n    <figcaption>Bibimbap</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure lang=\"da\">\n    <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.brianm.me/images/posts/2020-review/æbleskiver.jpg\" alt=\"Æbleskiver\">\n    <figcaption>Æbleskiver</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"music\">Music <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#music\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span>#</a></h4>\n<p>I listened to so much music this year. According to my <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/user/BrianMitchL/listening-report/year/2020\">last.fm stats</a>, I listened to roughly 38,000 songs this year, totaling somewhere around 90.5 days of play time between Spotify and Apple Music.\nNew for this year, I listened to some Trance and Drum and Bass music, as well as listening to a lot of the following artists (not an exhaustive list whatsoever):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>KSHMR</li>\n<li>Pendulum (released new music for the first time in ten years <span aria-label=\"smiling face with heart-shaped eyes\" class=\"emoji\" role=\"img\">😍</span>)</li>\n<li>Born I &amp; Tenka</li>\n<li>HIGHSOCIETY</li>\n<li>Desren</li>\n<li>Far Out</li>\n<li>Juelz</li>\n<li>QUIX</li>\n<li>CloZee</li>\n<li>Krewella</li>\n<li>Whipped Cream</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"video-container\">\n  <div>\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/woQsKqtrhfQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>\n    <figcaption>Juelz at Skyway Theater, February 29th, 2020</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h4 id=\"tv%2Fmovies\">TV/Movies <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#tv%2Fmovies\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span>#</a></h4>\n<p>I think I probably watched more TV this year, but not loads more, and I didn't really pick up the pace until I moved to my own apartment in the summer. I finally finished watching all the Fast and Furious movies, they're entertaining and exactly what you expect, which makes them easy to watch. I watched both seasons of The Mandalorian and all of Fleabag. This year marked the end of the great Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. I've recently been watching Insight No. 9, Raised by Wolves, and Star Trek: Discovery.</p>\n<p>That was all nice and all, but I mostly included this section to encourage you to watch the Netflix show Dark. I binged it in a little over two weeks and it quickly became one of my all-time favorite shows. The show is all in German, which is great for my travel-starved mind, and deals with time. Saying much more would spoil it, but it's a truly incredible show and I cannot implore you enough to watch it. Seriously.</p>\n<h4 id=\"games\">Games <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#games\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span>#</a></h4>\n<p>I hardly played any board games this year, but I did play a few virtual games of Settlers of Catan and Secret Hitler. Are jigsaw puzzles games? Either way I did a couple of those.</p>\n<p>I downloaded a solitaire app on my phone this spring. I've played maybe 2,000 games (I don't want to know how much time that took <span aria-label=\"eyes\" class=\"emoji\" role=\"img\">👀</span>). I started up a Minecraft server in April and have spent quite a bit of time getting into that again. Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition came out this fall, so I've had a lot of fun playing that too!</p>\n<h2 id=\"work\">Work <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#work\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span>#</a></h2>\n<p>This fall I hit my four-year work anniversary! I worked on some really challenging problems and features at work this year. Here are some highlights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Upgraded to <a href=\"https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-table\">react-table</a> v7 and rewrote our application's tables to dramatically improve the user experience and feature set.</li>\n<li>Integrated <a href=\"https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query\">react-query</a> to our application and added the concept of client-side caching, all while reducing the amount of code and complexity of the codebase.</li>\n<li>Tracked the routing history and synchronized parts of the application state into the router state for restoring users to the point they expect to be when they go forwards and backwards. This turned out to be an extraordinarily complex feature to build and I'm truly amazed and proud we got it to work.</li>\n<li>Refactored, to the point of nearly rewriting, our application's end-to-end tests (using <a href=\"https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/\">Puppeteer</a>) to support automatic retries. I learned about and fairly moderately used XPath selectors for common helpers which makes writing new tests easier and more clear. XPath selectors are wicked powerful and definitely worth checking out if you're ever scripting a browser.</li>\n<li>Lots and lots of code reviews (which I really enjoy doing).</li>\n<li>Co-wrote a blog post about <a href=\"https://engineering.chrobinson.com/technology/moving-to-react-testing-library/\">Moving to React Testing Library</a>.</li>\n<li>Gave an internal talk about using React Hooks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"side-projects\">Side Projects <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#side-projects\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span>#</a></h2>\n<p>I finally wrote a frontend for my <a href=\"https://github.com/BrianMitchL/gift-exchange\">gift-exchange</a> library. If you've ever wanted to match people together for a secret Santa gift exchange, then this could be your tool! It supports grouping people together and complex exclusion handling. Head to <a href=\"https://brianm.me/secret-santa/\">https://brianm.me/secret-santa/</a> to check it out.</p>\n<p>I moved my <a href=\"https://github.com/BrianMitchL/lastfm-proxy\">last.fm proxy</a> CloudFlare Worker to a proper GitHub repo and have it auto deployed with a GitHub Action.</p>\n<p>I overhauled my ZSH command-line setup to use the <a href=\"https://starship.rs\">Starship prompt</a> and removed oh-my-zsh in favor of fully owning the configuration. See the code in my <a href=\"https://github.com/BrianMitchL/dotfiles\">dotfiles repo</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/brandon_mn\">Brandon</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryanmr\">Ryan</a>, and I continued to make monthly episodes of our podcast, <a href=\"http://thenexus.tv/category/pk/\">PodKit</a>, a show about Apple inclined Web Developers discussing web development and technology in general. We just published <a href=\"http://thenexus.tv/pk63\">PodKit 63</a> where we discussed our favorite web-dev tech of 2020!</p>\n<p>I continued to co-organizer the <a href=\"https://javascriptmn.com\">JavaScriptMN</a> meetup. We had two in-person events at the beginning of the year before taking a hiatus starting in March, and then resuming with virtual events in the summer. This fall, Ryan and I redesigned the website to use TailwindCSS and Eleventy, which was a lot of fun, and only included one night of working together in a Zoom call until 05:00! <span aria-label=\"shushing face\" class=\"emoji\" role=\"img\">🤫</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"what-i-missed-in-2020\">What I Missed in 2020 <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#what-i-missed-in-2020\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span>#</a></h2>\n<p>There's a lot I could say here, but I think in general, I made fairly good use of my year, given the social <s>distancing</s> isolation this year.</p>\n<h3 id=\"socialization\">Socialization <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#socialization\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span>#</a></h3>\n<p>While I did see my parents and some family and friends outdoors throughout the year, I definitely interacted with way fewer people. Other than the day I moved, no one has been in my apartment. I would love to host some friends and family for some gatherings, but for now and at least the medium-term, that will have to wait. I also really miss the local tech meetup scene and meeting and conversing with others. The virtual events, especially those with breakout rooms or are attended by a smaller group of people (hi CodePen Meetup!), can replicate some of that, but it's not the same.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-hug\">A Hug <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#a-hug\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span>#</a></h3>\n<p>I hugged my parents most recently in mid-March, but no one since. 2021, once I'm vaccinated and the consensus seems to be that it's safe, it's going to happen! <span aria-label=\"happy face with hugging hands\" class=\"emoji\" role=\"img\">🤗</span></p>\n<p>Okay yeah, maybe I could have done it this year, but it's also the principle of it. I find it easier to just eliminate all close contact and avoid having to create a set of rules or list of people to negotiate with.</p>\n<h3 id=\"travel\">Travel <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#travel\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span>#</a></h3>\n<p>I'm so happy I was able to travel to Vietnam in January. I was also able to leave the Twin Cities a few times this fall and go hiking in some Minnesota state parks. In a normal year, I like to spend all but a couple of days of my paid time off on travelling, but this year I spent most of my days off hanging around in my apartment. It was nice to relax, but a far cry from what I was originally planning for this year.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.brianm.me/images/posts/2020-review/wild-river.jpg\" alt=\"St. Croix River at Wild River State Park\">\n  <figcaption>Wild River State Park</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"review\">Review <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#review\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span>#</a></h2>\n<p>This year certainly wasn't what I expected it to be at the beginning, but for a micro personal level, I think it turned out okay. We all made individual sacrifices this year, but for the benefit of everyone else, saving countless lives. Keep it up, mask up, and maybe we can see each other in person next year. <span aria-label=\"hand with fingers split between middle and ring fingers\" class=\"emoji\" role=\"img\">🖖</span></p>\n"

This explains SO many of weird problems I&#39;ve had over the years! 🤯</p>&mdash; Brian Mitchell (@BrianMitchL) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrianMitchL/status/1244749160751837186?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 30, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>I didn't notice this for a long time, but if you have a series of elements that have a <code>margin-top</code> and <code>margin-bottom</code> set, the browser uses the largest (when the values are positive) value for the margin between the elements. This concept, called <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Mastering_margin_collapsing\">margin collapsing</a>, becomes important with spacing block elements, using borders, set height, or clearing floats. To help with preventing this from happening (and better component isolation), I've even seen the argument for <a href=\"https://mxstbr.com/thoughts/margin\">Margin considered harmful</a>. If you need to override collapsed margins you can add wrapper elements, use padding, or fixed height spacer elements.</p>\n<h3 id=\"example\">Example <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#example\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span>#</a></h3>\n<p>Each <code>p</code> has a <code>margin-top</code> of <code>0.25rem</code> and <code>margin-bottom</code> of <code>1rem</code>, but because the bottom is larger than the top, the resulting space is <code>1rem</code>. Each <code>p</code> still has the margin set, but if the parent element does not have any padding or borders of its own, it collapses the margins for its height, and the margin of the children might be outside the parent.</p>\n<details>\n  <summary>See the code!</summary>\n<pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span

Have you ever been working on a site and come across z-indexes of hundreds or thousands? It's wild, right? I've found that once I understood <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context\">stacking contexts</a> and how positioning works with <code>z-index</code> and DOM order, I almost never needed to use a <code>z-index</code> above <code>1</code> or <code>2</code> (unless I needed to override or stack on top of a 3rd party library that had it set very high). I can't think of a better example than the one on the MDN page linked above, check it out!</p>\n<h2 id=\"focus-visible\">focus-visible <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#focus-visible\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span>#</a></h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-visible\"><code>:focus-visible</code></a> pseudo selector is an <a href=\"https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors-4/#the-focus-visible-pseudo\">upcoming feature</a> that lets you style the focus state of an element differently based on how the user is interacting with the web page (mouse/tap vs keyboard). This lets you create focus rings around elements only when using the <kbd>Tab</kbd>, <kbd>Shift + Tab</kbd>, or arrow keys, while keeping the page clean from focus rings when interacting with a mouse. Browser support is not universal yet, but there is a wonderful <a href=\"https://github.com/WICG/focus-visible\">focus-visible polyfill</a> maintained by the Web Incubator Community Group which provides the feature in the form of a class or data attribute that you can use as a selector instead.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Different browsers and OSes have different behavior for focusing buttons when clicking on them.

href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position#Sticky_positioning\">Sticky positioning</a> has been around for years, but IE11 doesn't (and will never) support it, so I hadn't ever actually used it. This lets you have an element flow as if it were relatively positioned until it reaches the edge of the containing block (through scrolling). From there it behaves more closely to fixed positioning, but only on the axis anchored with a <code>top</code>, <code>left</code>, <code>right</code>, or <code>bottom</code> property and within the bounds of its parent element. For the site I used it, we accepted that IE would have a slightly degraded experience by not supporting it, due to the difficulty of writing a replacement to sticky positioning with JavaScript for our scenario.</p>\n<h2 id=\"accessibility-with-display%3A-none\">Accessibility with display: none <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#accessibility-with-display%3A-none\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span>#</a></h2>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\" data-theme=\"light\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Also TIL, when styling labels that wrap radio inputs, _of course_ they won&#39;t be keyboard navigable if the inputs are set to `display: none`.

It still exists in the DOM, and can be toggled through clicking on a linked label, but otherwise it's effectively not there. To avoid this from happening, I found that the following CSS is a great way to visually hide the input while keeping it visible for focus management, tabbing with a keyboard, and being spoken with screen readers.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-css\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token property\">position</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> absolute<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br>// use clip for legacy browsers<br><span class=\"token property\">clip</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token function\">rect</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>0<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> 0<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> 0<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> 0<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span><br><span class=\"token property\">clip-path</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token function\">circle</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>0<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"example-2\">Example <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#example-2\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span>#</a></h3>\n<p>Note: Depending on your OS and browser, you may need to enable additional features for keyboard navigation.

This is despite the fact that they both visually look and work the same. An <span style=\"display:inline-block;border: 0.25rem solid orangered;\">orangered border</span> indicates that a checkbox is checked.</p>\n<details>\n  <summary>See the code!</summary>\n<pre

We recently changed our internal tooling to use React Testing Library for rendering components in tests for new applications. I've been using React Testing library since React hooks were released in February 2019 and found that it brings many benefits to testing. I've been advocating for teams to use React Testing Library and am thrilled to see it used as the new default.</p>\n"

I was assigned to a civil case\nthat went for nine days. It was a long one, but I learned a lot about the\njudicial process, and really enjoyed taking the bus into downtown\nMinneapolis and living that city life!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In August, as part of a trip with my family, I spent a day in Yosemite\nNational Park. The Sequoia grove as well as the valley were beautiful!\nAfter seeing the half-dome and El Capitan as the wallpapers from macOS, I\nwas thrilled to be able to see them in person. This park had been on my\nlist of sights to see for a very long time, so I am thrilled to have been\nable to visit.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In late August, I found my way back to Salt Lake City, Utah for\n<a href=\"https://www.reactrally.com\">React Rally</a>, a community conference about\n<a href=\"https://reactjs.org\">React</a> and topics interesting to React developers. I\nmet some great people, saw some terrific talks, and feel much more connected\nto the React community at large. Pro tip, stay an extra day, or arrive early\nto a tech conference if you can. There will be others who do the same, and\nbeing able to hang out with people while going on a hike, playing board\ngames, or exploring the city was a huge highlight of my time there.</p>\n   <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B1mkbUIHRhe/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

The first was a long lightning talk\n(~15 minutes) about React and <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org\">TypeScript</a>\nat JavaScriptMN in March. I adapted that into a full-length talk and\npresented it at <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/React-Minneapolis-Meetup/events/257861771/\">React Minneapolis</a>\nin July. Finally, I gave a talk about\n<a href=\"https://testing-library.com/react\">React Testing Library</a> for React\nMinneapolis in October with only hours notice ahead of time (it went great).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I read several books this year.

I have\nreally pushed further learning, developing, and teaching React, TypeScript,\nReact Testing Library, React hooks, and other front-end tools, patterns,\nand concepts at work. I'm so glad that I've been able to focus on front-end\ndevelopment and work to become a more experienced software engineer this\npast year.

      "content_html": "<p>For years, I have tried to describe the style of music I listen to. This post is an attempt at doing that.</p>\n<p>To most people, I probably would not describe my tastes in music as &quot;normal.&quot; A quick summary I tell people is that if it has a guitar in it, I probably do not listen to it. While that is not always true, I find a statement like that is easier to say than getting into the intricacies of my tastes in Electronic, Trap, and Hip-Hop/Rap music. I will attempt to get into those details and reflect on the music I listen to.</p>\n<p>This post gets nuanced, so if you do not read the whole thing, no worries! I do suggest at least checking out the <a href=\"#remixes\">Remixes</a> section, as I think it is more important than most of what I have to say about my personal interests in this post. :sweat_smile:</p>\n<h2 id=\"origins\">Origins <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#origins\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span>#</a></h2>\n<p>Way back when I was a kid, I remember listening to some tapes with my dad. He played an album of a band that used focused more on the drums than I had heard before. Seemingly, from that point on, I have focused on the drums or beat of a song. I think a lot of that is due to the fact that I liked Hip-Hop beats, but was not really exposed to them in a great amount until fourth grade (2003-2004).</p>\n<p>In fourth grade, a couple of days a week after school, I went to another elementary school until my parents came and picked me up. The bus driver on this other route would play the local Hip-Hop and Pop station. Oh man was I exposed to a lot of music that year! Some notable songs I first heard then are a few from Sean Paul's album &quot;Dutty Rock&quot;, &quot;In da Club&quot; by 50 Cent, &quot;Hey Ya!&quot; by Outkast, and the infamous &quot;Yeah!&quot; by Usher.</p>\n<p>In junior high, I listened to a lot of &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic and small independent musicians from the Newgrounds Audio Portal. In high school (2008-2012), I started exploring more and listened to a lot of electronic music artists like Bassnectar, Pendulum, Pretty Lights, Basshunter, Skrillex, Diplo, Klaypex, as well as Hip-Hop/Rap like Eminem and The Lonely Island.</p>\n<h2 id=\"discovery\">Discovery <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#discovery\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span>#</a></h2>\n<p>I used to discover new music fairly organically from friends and out-and-about.</p>\n<p>In 2012, I started using SoundCloud for most of my discovery. Musicians, especially ones just starting out, would upload their music with links to download the song. Many artists created playlists and would add to them and re-post other songs. For a while, I listened to (or at least part of) every song in my stream in order to discover new music.</p>\n<p>In 2015, when Apple released Apple Music, I started adding music to my library through that instead of hunting down MP3s from SoundCloud and &quot;other sources&quot;. A year or two later, Apple added the generated My New Music playlist, similar to Spotify's Discovery Weekly and Release Radar playlists. I still listen to it every week when it's updated.</p>\n<p>By the end of 2016, when I was working full time, it became more time-consuming to keep up with all the new music that was flowing through my SoundCloud stream. This is when I started using Spotify much more for discovery. I listen to the generated Discovery Weekly and Release Radar playlists every week when they're updated, in addition to a few playlists curated by artists and labels I listen.</p>\n<p>Every so often I will open up SoundCloud and get lost down a rabbit hole of artists, finding new music, but for the most part, I listen to and discover music exclusively on Apple Music and Spotify.</p>\n<h2 id=\"genres\">Genres <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#genres\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span>#</a></h2>\n<p>From a high level, I would say I listen to the following genres:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Hip-Hop/Rap</li>\n<li>Trap</li>\n<li>EDM (Electronic Dance Music)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These three genres can all blend together in very interesting ways. I will mostly focus on Trap music, as I feel that is the genre I listen to the most.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hip-hop%2Frap\">Hip-Hop/Rap <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#hip-hop%2Frap\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span>#</a></h3>\n<p>I definitely like Hip-Hop/Rap that is more of a Trap music style (which I will touch on in a minute). I generally listen to songs that are produced in certain styles over blanketly listening to certain artists. Some albums are mostly produced by one producer, but other albums have a mix of several producers. Some producers that I follow are DJ Mustard, Mike Will Made-It, and Judge, among others. Some artists that I listen to include Kid Ink, Rae Sremmurd, Cardi B, Nicki Minaj, 2 Chainz, Travis Scott, The Weeknd, Migos, Quavo, Iggy Azalea, and EMP. I also listen to a lot of Danish rap, see <a href=\"#lyrics\">Lyrics</a> for a playlist.</p>\n<h3 id=\"trap\">Trap <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#trap\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span>#</a></h3>\n<p>Trap music really means two genres, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap_music\">Trap music</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap_music_(EDM)\">Trap music (EDM)</a>. EDM Trap spun out of the non-electronic form, which stems from southern Hip-Hop. EDM trap is a relatively new genre, starting in 2012. I first discovered it in early 2013 through, what I call the meme that changed my life, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_Shake_(meme)\">Harlem Shake meme</a>. Starting with Baauer and Harlem Shake, I quickly started following related artists on SoundCloud and bought the All Trap Music Vol. 1 album.</p>\n<figure>\n  <iframe allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *;\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"450\" style=\"width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" src=\"https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/all-trap-music/596546230\"></iframe>\n  <figcaption>All Trap Music Vol. 1 album</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>For the remainder of college and into the year afterward, I heavily used SoundCloud to listen to and discover new music. You can check out my <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/brianmitchl\">profile</a> if you are interested in the artists I follow and songs I have liked or reposted.</p>\n<p>EDM Trap music has changed quite a bit since 2012. In the early days, songs were simpler and had a smaller soundscape. Today, EDM Trap can be further broken into several sub-genres, of which, I would put into four rough categories.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Hip-Hop</li>\n<li>Festival/House</li>\n<li>Future Bass/Chill Trap</li>\n<li>Hybrid Trap/Dubstep</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Hip-Hop is most similar, if not the same, to non-EDM Trap music, and may contain rap verses or not (released as an instrumental). Songs in this sub-genre are often on the more minimal side, with a focus on the beat and without heavy drops or aggressive synthesizers. Festival/House Trap may also be called &quot;mainstream&quot; and is easier to dance to. Future Bass/Chill Trap are more mellow and have softer beats and a more laid back feeling. Hybrid Trap/Dubstep is the hardest sub-genre of Trap music. Much like Hip-Hop and Trap music, the difference between heavy or Hybrid Trap music and Dubstep can be hard to differentiate, and there is no clear boundary.</p>\n<p>I listen to a variety of artists from all sub-genres. Lately, I have been slowly beginning to listen to heavier Trap, probably some sort of a mix of Festival Trap and Hybrid Trap. That being said, I am definitely not a big fan of Dubstep, so even I am a little surprised at my new-ish liking towards some harder Trap music.</p>\n<figure>\n  <iframe allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *;\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"450\" style=\"width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" src=\"https://embed.music.apple.com/us/playlist/hard-trap/pl.u-dN5rZFMMMEey\"></iframe>\n  <figcaption>My Hard Trap playlist</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3 id=\"edm\">EDM <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#edm\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span>#</a></h3>\n<p>EDM and dance music has been around for decades, but has changed a lot over time, and is filled with a multitude of sub-genres. EDM has been especially on the rise since the turn of the century, and I would say has heavily influenced Pop music in the last decade. To spare myself I will just link you to the Wikipedia page on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_dance_music\">Electronic Dance Music</a> which goes into much more depth than I care to on such a large genre. :wink:</p>\n<p>Some artists that come to mind that have brought EDM to the mainstream to the point where it blends with Pop music are David Guetta, Avicii, Calvin Harris, DJ Snake, and The Chainsmokers.</p>\n<figure class=\"video-container\">\n  <div>\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DoUV7Q1C1SU\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>\n  <figcaption>SNL Digital Short: When Will The Bass Drop?</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h4 id=\"mainstream%2Felectro-house\">Mainstream/Electro House <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#mainstream%2Felectro-house\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span>#</a></h4>\n<p>I would call this the most popular style of EDM, and is what is frequently played at large festivals and is most similar to EDM style Pop music. Songs are usually around 128 beats per minute, that :sparkles: magical :sparkles: dance tempo. There are many sub-genres of Electro House, some of which I like more or less than others. I do not particularly seek out Electro House music, but I enjoy listening to it when I hear it in playlists, at shows, or when I am out-and-about.</p>\n<h4 id=\"melbourne-bounce\">Melbourne Bounce <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#melbourne-bounce\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span>#</a></h4>\n<p>Melbourne Bounce is a pretty specific sub-genre (microgenre?) of EDM that I have yet to meet someone who likes it as much as I do (if you love this, please reach out :smile:). I heard a Will Sparks song or remix several years ago, and have been looking for more ever since. Other notable artists that I listen to in this genre are Deorro, Joel Fletcher, Ger3to, and Ortal Israel. An upbeat bass, fast tempo, and Electro House and Trance influences define the genre.</p>\n<figure>\n  <iframe allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *;\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"450\" style=\"width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" src=\"https://embed.music.apple.com/us/playlist/bounce/pl.u-dNrA0CMMMEey\"></iframe>\n  <figcaption>My Bounce playlist (there are more songs in this playlist, but not all are on Apple Music)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Similar, but not entirely the same, I have recently discovered Timmy Trumpet, who blends the bounce sound with Electro House and takes it towards Trance music.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lyrics\">Lyrics <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#lyrics\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span>#</a></h2>\n<p>A lot of the music I listen to is light on lyrics, if it has any at all. Even with lyrics, I generally do not actively listen to the words. There are songs I have listened to hundreds of times that I could not sing along to. That being said, I do really value lyrics in songs. They add an irreplaceable &quot;voice&quot; (ha!) and natural sound to a song. The rhythm, melody, and tone of a voice is more important to me than the language that the singer/lyricist is conveying.</p>\n<p>I listen to many Danish (as well as other languages such as a little French, Swedish, and Norwegian) artists. Unless I am trying really hard (and even then my Danish is not even close to being good enough), I usually do not have more than a general idea about what the rapper (most of the Danish music I listen to is rap) is talking about. If I am really liking a song, I will look up and read the lyrics, and often run them through Google Translate as well.</p>\n<figure>\n  <iframe allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *;\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"450\" style=\"width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" src=\"https://embed.music.apple.com/us/playlist/euro-rap/pl.u-3GZr5hPPP5Ka\"></iframe>\n  <figcaption>My Euro Rap playlist</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3 id=\"vocal-effects\">Vocal Effects <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#vocal-effects\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span>#</a></h3>\n<p>While not necessarily lyrics (but they can be), I love vocal effects. Whether the lyrics are processed with distortion or reverb, or heavily chopped to the point that they are no longer words, vocal effects are a effective way of applying a human sound into a song and giving it a unique and organic sound.</p>\n<p>A few weeks ago, I was listening to music, as I do, and thought, &quot;Nothing says 'Saturday morning' like some electro-pop with vocal effects.&quot; Here is a prime example (toward the end of the preview):</p>\n<figure>\n  <iframe allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *;\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"150\" style=\"width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" src=\"https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/dont-you-know/1337351889?i=1337352088\"></iframe>\n  <figcaption>Don't You Know by Neovaii</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"remixes\">Remixes <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#remixes\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span>#</a></h2>\n<p>If you have not spent any time listening to or searching for remixes, I highly recommend you watch Kirby Ferguson's fantastic series, <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/139094998\">Everything is a Remix</a>. I also suggest you look up some of your favorite songs, particularity if they are Hip-Hop or Electronic, on <a href=\"https://www.whosampled.com\">Who Sampled</a>, which shows songs that sample from other songs (and vice versa). The amount of sampling/remixing in &quot;original&quot; songs may surprise you.</p>\n<p>I have shifted most of my music discovery to Apple Music and Spotify these days, so I unfortunately do not listen to as many remixes as I used to. SoundCloud is a great place for independent artists to upload and share their original and remix songs. Because there does not <em>need</em> to be a music label involved for legal approval, I have found that there are more remixes on SoundCloud than anywhere else. Roughly 7.5% (over 1,200 songs) of the music in my iTunes library are remixes. Some of my favorite songs are remixes, and especially when I heavily used SoundCloud, I would often hear the latest popular songs first as a remix.</p>\n<figure>\n  <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/689843388&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>\n  <figcaption>Remix playlist on SoundCloud</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"shows%2Fconcerts\">Shows/Concerts <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#shows%2Fconcerts\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span>#</a></h2>\n<p>As a preface, not long after I started going to Electronic music shows I purchased a pair of ear plugs and have worn them the entire time for every show. Protect your ears, enjoy music for a lifetime :ear:</p>\n<p>I have attended countless shows at The Loft in downtown Minneapolis (as well as a couple of other venues), where many artists I listen to have come and played sets. I enjoy going to these shows because not only am I there to see the artist or two who are headlining, but also the local producers and DJs who play before them, and the lights and a space to dance to music! I have discovered several artists through going to shows or using Shazam to identify a song I am hearing. Some of the more memorable shows I have been to include artists like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alexander Lewis</li>\n<li>Alison Wonderland</li>\n<li>Boombox Cartel</li>\n<li>CloZee</li>\n<li>Dillon Francis</li>\n<li>Droeloe</li>\n<li>Ekali</li>\n<li>The Glitch Mob</li>\n<li>GTA</li>\n<li>Juelz</li>\n<li>JVNA</li>\n<li>Knife Party</li>\n<li>KRANE</li>\n<li>Medasin</li>\n<li>Memba</li>\n<li>Pendulum</li>\n<li>QUIX</li>\n<li>Stööki Sound</li>\n<li>TroyBoi</li>\n<li>UZ</li>\n<li>Yellow Claw</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#conclusion\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span>#</a></h2>\n<p>My tastes in music have certainly changed over the years. I think it has evolved with me growing up and becoming independent, meeting new people, the music industry changing with streaming platforms, the rise in artists independently releasing their music, and me following musicians on the Internet. I am curious how my tastes in music will change over the next few years as I get older and new styles are created. A few times in the last decade, I have thought, &quot;this new style is awesome, I have now peaked,&quot; only to find myself thinking that again just months later. According to <a href=\"https://skynetandebert.com/2015/04/22/music-was-better-back-then-when-do-we-stop-keeping-up-with-popular-music/\">a study</a>, in general, music tastes evolve quickly in the teen years and into the mid-20s, and by the mid-30s, music tastes &quot;mature&quot;. We will see...</p>\n<p>Hopefully you got something out of this post, I sure did just from researching for it :smile:.</p>\n"

I have two\nin my bedroom, and a combination of two outlets and an LED strip in my living room.\nIt's very colorful and fun. For the ultimate hands-free (lazy?) life, I have them\nset up to automatically turn on or off if I arrive or leave home, respectively :grin:.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I started working with <a href=\"https://reactjs.org\">React</a> and\n<a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org\">TypeScript</a> quite extensively at work. My team\ntransformed and became focused on a new project so I was able to learn and start\nbuilding the new codebase with modern tools and libraries. I've also spent a lot of\ntime helping and mentoring other UI developers learn and troubleshoot similar setups.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In January - March, I was Lighting Designer for Young Artists Initiative’s production\nof <em>Annie</em>. I hadn't worked on a show since graduating from college in 2016, so I was delighted\nto have the opportunity again.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In April, some friends and I traveled to Estonia, Latvia, and Ukraine. The cities I\nvisited were beautiful, and seeing the city of Pripyat, the Chernobyl Nuclear Power\nPlant, and Duga Radar was an incredible, heartbreaking, and one of the most unique experiences\nI have ever had.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BhmRS-CHmPF/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

We're notoriously bad at\nany sort of consistency.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I read books this year! I listened to <em>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</em> by Douglas\nAdams and <em>Artemis</em> by Andy Weir. I'm also part way through <em>Typeset in the Future: Typography\nand Design in Science Fiction Movies</em> by Dave Addey. I recommend all of them!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finally, I went to more concerts/shows this year than any year before. I went to nearly\nall EDM shows of some sort at The Loft, Skyway Theater Main Stage, and First Ave. Don't worry,\nI happily wear my ear plugs to every show and am glad that the city of Minneapolis requires concert\nvenues to provide them for free in case I forget them. My favorite show was definitely CloZee at\nThe Loft at the end of September. Her music is a unique and wonderful blend of electronic and\nbass music, with undertones and influences from all over the world.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>2018 was a great year and I am looking forward to seeing what next year brings!

The Plus sized iPhones always seemed way too\nlarge, but something about this even <em>larger</em> screen seemed enticing.</p>\n<p>Like the 4.7&quot; displays over the earlier 4&quot; and even 3.5&quot; displays, it's impossible\nto reach the entire display. I find myself gripping the iPhone\nX<span class=\"small-caps\">S</span> Max with two hands much more frequently than\nearlier iPhones. Part of this is for stability to make sure I don't drop the phone,\nbut it's also so I can interact with everything that's on the screen.

This means that if black is being displayed on the display, the pixels\naren't even lit. A trade-off of this is that if you are switching from black\nto any other color, there is a small delay because the pixel needs to turn itself\non.

It has a dual camera system, like the Plus sized iPhones\nfrom the past four years: a wide-angle ƒ/1.8 and a telephoto ƒ/2.4. New with\nthe iPhone X<span class=\"small-caps\">S</span> is that the wide-angle lens\nnow has a 26 mm equivalent focal length (compared to 28 mm on the iPhone X),\nwhich means you can fit a bit more from a scene into the frame.</p>\n<p>The sensors in the new iPhone also are about <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2018/09/the_iphones_xs\">30% larger</a>,\nwhich reduces noise and increases brightness in dark areas. Both the wide-angle\nand telephoto sensors have a wider ISO range, which further helps to reduce\ngrain. Photos can now be exposed at up to one second (1/3 second in earlier\niPhones).</p>\n<p>I'd highly recommend looking at the\n<a href=\"http://halide.cam/\">Halide</a> team's <a href=\"https://blog.halide.cam/iphone-xs-vs-iphone-x-the-camera-hardware-changes-496b40ceae3a\">hardware breakdown</a>\nand more software focused <a href=\"https://blog.halide.cam/iphone-xs-why-its-a-whole-new-camera-ddf9780d714c\">iPhone XS: Why It's A Whole New Camera</a>.\nBoth posts go into great detail about the improvements in the iPhone\nX<span class=\"small-caps\">S</span>'s camera(s); it's truly impressive.</p>\n<h4 id=\"photo\">Photo <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#photo\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span>#</a></h4>\n<p>Apple introduced Portrait mode with the iPhone X last year, but this is\na first for me. It works the same way as the X, but you can now adjust the\nbokeh effect during or after taking the photo. From the few portrait photos\nI've taken, I'm quite impressed.</p>\n<p>What excites me most about the new cameras are the improved sensors combined\nwith the new Smart HDR. Apple introduced HDR with the iPhone 4 back in 2010;\nIt took a photo at normal, above, and below exposure. I think it has continued\nto work in mostly the same way until now. Smart HDR takes several more photos at different\nexposures, and uses the A12 Bionic's Neural Engine to stitch the final photo back together,\ncombining the different exposures. This makes for incredible detail, almost in\nan unnatural way (at least when comparing to traditional cameras), where areas\nthat would normally be over or under exposed are now included at an exposure\nthat matches that area's brightness into the final image.</p>\n<h4 id=\"video\">Video <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#video\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span>#</a></h4>\n<p>The camera on the iPhone X<span class=\"small-caps\">S</span> will step down\nthe frame rate of a 30fps video to 24fps if there isn't enough brightness in\nthe scene. This will increase the brightness and detail in video recorded in\nlow-light scenes.</p>\n<p>New with this iPhone, video is recorded with stereo microphones! :tada:</p>\n<p>New last year with the iPhone 8 and X (but new to me), video can be recorded at\n60 fps when using the HEVC codec. Good thing I got the 256 GB iPhone, because\nvideo at that quality uses a ton of disk space.</p>\n<figure class=\"video-container\">\n  <div>\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jeNbrPEMQgc\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n  </div>\n  <figcaption>Video example. This looks even better in 4K at 60fps with the raw 217.2 MB HEVC file.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3 id=\"other\">Other <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#other\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span>#</a></h3>\n<p>The iPhone X<span class=\"small-caps\">S</span> is now rated for IP68 water\nresistance (maximum depth of 2 meters up to 30 minutes). This is a nice improvement\non something I hope to never have to test. Though, I did once bike with my iPhone 7\nin my bike mount while it was raining, because I knew it should be fine (it was).</p>\n<p>The battery life in this iPhone is incredible! I really wasn't expecting such an\nimprovement. One day I left work and my phone still had 86% battery left! I\ndidn't charge it that night, and finally plugged it in right before bed the day\nafter, at 1% left. I don't think I've ever gotten two full days out of a single\ncharge on any of my iPhones in the past.</p>\n<p>The physical form of the iPhone X<span class=\"small-caps\">S</span> Max is nearly\nthe same as the iPhone 8 Plus, but with a stainless steel band around the sides\nand an awesome edge-to-edge OLED display.</p>\n<p>I picked up a Qi charger with my iPhone and use it to charge every night. It's a\nsmall thing, but it's nice to just rest the iPhone on my bedside table and it just\nstarts charging. Sometimes it takes a little nudge to get lined up, but it emits a\nsound when it starts charging, so it doesn't bother me at all.</p>\n<p>FaceID is great most of the time. I'm used to it now, but every so often I do wish\nI could unlock my phone without needing to point the phone towards my face. However,\nonce the phone is unlocked I love how easy FaceID is. If I'm already using the phone, it\nauthenticates me without requiring me to do anything. My favorite use of this is with\nthe 1Password extension for entering passwords on websites and apps. All I need to do\nis tap the suggestion in the QuickType area above the keyboard and it automatically\nverifies my face and enters the username and password. I hope FaceID gets faster over\ntime, I feel like I always have to wait for the animation to finish when authenticating\nmyself in apps.</p>\n<p>The iPhone X<span class=\"small-caps\">S</span> now also has 4 GB of RAM, which will\nallow for better multi-tasking and more advanced applications that consume lots of\nmemory.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#conclusion\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span>#</a></h2>\n<p>In short, <span aria-label=\"two thumbs up\" class=\"emoji\" role=\"img\">👍👍</span>!</p>\n<p>I'm happy with my decision to try the larger sized model of iPhone. I have to be\nmore careful when holding it to minimize the risk of dropping it due to the\nlarger size and weight, but it's important to protect your phone either way, right?\nWhile I never really thought my iPhone 7 was very slow, the six-core A12 Bionic is\ncertainly much faster. I look forward to continuing to take even better photos with\nthe much improved camera(s).</p>\n"

At the time, I had a\none-year-old 15&quot; MacBook Pro but was looking for a desktop/server to host the Minecraft server I was running at the\ntime. I waited for the Mountain Lion update (10.8.5) that added support for Intel's 4th generation Haswell CPUs to be\nreleased, and promptly bought the remaining components.</p>\n<p>After a couple of days, I had it up and running using <a href=\"https://www.tonymacx86.com\">tonymacx86</a> guides with the\nChimera/Chameleon bootloader for BIOS<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\">[1]</a></sup> booting. The following Spring I triple booted it with Windows 8.1 and\nUbuntu. In the Fall of 2014 I upgraded to the Clover<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\">[2]</a></sup> bootloader in order to boot from EFI<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\">[3]</a></sup>. A year later I\npurchased a used Apple Broadcom BCM94360CD wireless card from a user on reddit and was able to use Handoff, Continuity,\nand unlock the Hackintosh with my Apple Watch (this came later). In July 2017, I switched the case and\nmotherboard with my server in order to have a smaller case on my desk. From there on out, the hardware remained\nunchanged.</p>\n<p>Over the years, I definitely had problems along with the reliability of the build. When using the BIOS-based\nChimera bootloader, I had problems with it crashing after waking from sleep, and general instability. After upgrading\nto Clover, stability improved, but would still crash every so often.</p>\n<p>Starting with macOS Sierra in the fall of 2017, it started to crash more often, nearly always related to graphics\nissues. For some reason, JetBrains IDEs would very frequently cause it to crash. It once crashed when hovering over a\nlink with an emoji in Safari. Twice, it crashed while recording a podcast for <a href=\"https://thenexus.tv\">The Nexus</a>, which\nresulted in total loss of the recording.</p>\n<p>On a more positive note, High Sierra became more reliable. I feel like the Hackintosh was a quite good &quot;Mac&quot;, and it\nsupported all major features of a new Mac throughout its life. I was even able to install some new major updates to macOS on the day of their release.</p>\n<p>Seeing as the vast majority of the crashes later in its life were due to graphics issues (always read your logs in\nConsole.app), I would have likely had a much more reliable machine if I had upgraded to a newer GPU. During much of\nHigh Sierra, I often put the Hackintosh to sleep, and would continue to use it for another day or two without crashes.\nIn 2018, it only crashed a handful of times. Sometimes a month or two would go by!</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-demise\">The Demise <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#the-demise\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span>#</a></h2>\n<p>Sometime last week, I installed the Clover r4674 update like I always do when a newer version is available. When I\nbooted it up next on Saturday, it would not boot into Clover. When selecting the UEFI entry for the macOS SSD, the\nmotherboard manufacturer logos would just stay on the screen forever. Booting into Windows via the Windows Boot Manager\nwas fine, so was mounting the macOS SSD on my MacBook Pro. I tried restoring to Clover r4658, the earlier version that\nI had been using, to no avail.</p>\n<p>Now that I've been working full time for two years, and I don't have a computer newer than five years old, I've been\nplanning on purchasing an iMac to replace the Hackintosh when they're next updated (rumored to this fall!). I just\ncouldn't justify a full wipe and reinstall of the Hackintosh if I am going to be setting up a new Mac in a month or two.\nWith a new computer on the line, and much more limited time than when I was in college, I decided to call it and\nretire the Hackintosh.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reflection\">Reflection <a class=\"heading-link\" href=\"#reflection\"><span class=\"sr-only\">Permalink</span>#</a></h2>\n<p>Clover changed the game in terms of amount of work needed. Manual patches were able to be moved to boot-time patches\non whichever KEXT<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\">[4]</a></sup> was in need of modifying. Instead of loading KEXTs from the <code>/System/Library/Extentions</code>\ndirectory, KEXTs needed for booting were moved to being stored and injected from the EFI partition. This allows for\none configuration allowing to boot multiple volumes. I was able to boot the macOS Recovery partition!</p>\n<p>I've learned so many things about how lower levels of macOS and modern computers work. Building a Hackintosh was a\nfantastic way to get a high performance Mac for a lot less money. Now that I'm out of school, I appreciate stability\nand my time more than saving money and having a desire to keep tinkering and tweaking a custom-built computer. For\nstability, I started using my MacBook Pro for podcasting. For the last few years, the Hackintosh took a minute or more\nto boot up (probably a BIOS config issue, or some cache is lost and the OS runs extra checks on boot), so I would\nsometimes do quick things on my MacBook Pro or just use my iPad. I think those are some indicators that I'm really\nlooking for a new, fast, and stable Mac.</p>\n<p>RIP old friend.
