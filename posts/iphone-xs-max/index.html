That being said, there are new features on the iPhone X<span class="small-caps">S</span> (and me keeping an every-other-year upgrade cycle) that still made me decide to upgrade to the iPhone X<span class="small-caps">S</span> Max.</p><p>Now that I live within a ten-minute walk to an Apple Store, I decided to pick the phone up in store.

The Plus sized iPhones always seemed way too large, but something about this even <em>larger</em> screen seemed enticing.</p><p>Like the 4.7&quot; displays over the earlier 4&quot; and even 3.5&quot; displays, it's impossible to reach the entire display. I find myself gripping the iPhone X<span class="small-caps">S</span> Max with two hands much more frequently than earlier iPhones. Part of this is for stability to make sure I don't drop the phone, but it's also so I can interact with everything that's on the screen. This is a worthy trade off because I can see so much more on the screen, media is larger, and I can use the two-column layouts that are unique to iPads and iPhone Pluses (iPhones Plus?).</p><h3 id="speed">Speed <a class="heading-link" href="#speed"><span class="sr-only">Permalink</span>#</a></h3><p>The A12 Bionic SoC packs a 64-bit, 7 nm processor (the definition of a 7 nm processor can vary widely, so take it with a grain of salt) with six cores: two performance cores and four high-efficiency cores. It also includes a new &quot;8-core Neural Engine.&quot; Apple didn't market the chip as being all that much faster, especially with the A11 and A12 both sharing the &quot;Bionic&quot; name, but this chip is <em>fast</em>. <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/13392/the-iphone-xs-xs-max-review-unveiling-the-silicon-secrets">Some reports</a> go as far as saying the A12 Bionic is 40% faster than the A11 Bionic.</p><p>Here's a breakdown of Geekbench 4 results from the more recent iPhones and my current devices.

This means that if black is being displayed on the display, the pixels aren't even lit. A trade-off of this is that if you are switching from black to any other color, there is a small delay because the pixel needs to turn itself on. It is apparent when scrolling a list of items with a pure black theme. The edge content of an animating object seems to lag behind the rest.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What does OLED black smearing look like?

The OLED display makes it a joy to use at night when dark themes in apps kick in.</p><h3 id="camera">Camera <a class="heading-link" href="#camera"><span class="sr-only">Permalink</span>#</a></h3><p>The camera on the iPhone X<span class="small-caps">S</span> is the real flagship feature. It has a dual camera system, like the Plus sized iPhones from the past four years: a wide-angle ƒ/1.8 and a telephoto ƒ/2.4. New with the iPhone X<span class="small-caps">S</span> is that the wide-angle lens now has a 26 mm equivalent focal length (compared to 28 mm on the iPhone X), which means you can fit a bit more from a scene into the frame.</p><p>The sensors in the new iPhone also are about <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2018/09/the_iphones_xs">30% larger</a>, which reduces noise and increases brightness in dark areas. Both the wide-angle and telephoto sensors have a wider ISO range, which further helps to reduce grain. Photos can now be exposed at up to one second (1/3 second in earlier iPhones).</p><p>I'd highly recommend looking at the <a href="http://halide.cam/">Halide</a> team's <a href="https://blog.halide.cam/iphone-xs-vs-iphone-x-the-camera-hardware-changes-496b40ceae3a">hardware breakdown</a> and more software focused <a href="https://blog.halide.cam/iphone-xs-why-its-a-whole-new-camera-ddf9780d714c">iPhone XS: Why It's A Whole New Camera</a>. Both posts go into great detail about the improvements in the iPhone X<span class="small-caps">S</span>'s camera(s); it's truly impressive.</p><h4 id="photo">Photo <a class="heading-link" href="#photo"><span class="sr-only">Permalink</span>#</a></h4><p>Apple introduced Portrait mode with the iPhone X last year, but this is a first for me. It works the same way as the X, but you can now adjust the bokeh effect during or after taking the photo. From the few portrait photos I've taken, I'm quite impressed.</p><p>What excites me most about the new cameras are the improved sensors combined with the new Smart HDR. Apple introduced HDR with the iPhone 4 back in 2010; It took a photo at normal, above, and below exposure. I think it has continued to work in mostly the same way until now. Smart HDR takes several more photos at different exposures, and uses the A12 Bionic's Neural Engine to stitch the final photo back together, combining the different exposures. This makes for incredible detail, almost in an unnatural way (at least when comparing to traditional cameras), where areas that would normally be over or under exposed are now included at an exposure that matches that area's brightness into the final image.</p><h4 id="video">Video <a class="heading-link" href="#video"><span class="sr-only">Permalink</span>#</a></h4><p>The camera on the iPhone X<span class="small-caps">S</span> will step down the frame rate of a 30fps video to 24fps if there isn't enough brightness in the scene. This will increase the brightness and detail in video recorded in low-light scenes.</p><p>New with this iPhone, video is recorded with stereo microphones! :tada:</p><p>New last year with the iPhone 8 and X (but new to me), video can be recorded at 60 fps when using the HEVC codec. Good thing I got the 256 GB iPhone, because video at that quality uses a ton of disk space.</p><figure class="video-container"><div><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jeNbrPEMQgc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><figcaption>Video example. This looks even better in 4K at 60fps with the raw 217.2 MB HEVC file.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="other">Other <a class="heading-link" href="#other"><span class="sr-only">Permalink</span>#</a></h3><p>The iPhone X<span class="small-caps">S</span> is now rated for IP68 water resistance (maximum depth of 2 meters up to 30 minutes). This is a nice improvement on something I hope to never have to test. Though, I did once bike with my iPhone 7 in my bike mount while it was raining, because I knew it should be fine (it was).</p><p>The battery life in this iPhone is incredible! I really wasn't expecting such an improvement. One day I left work and my phone still had 86% battery left! I didn't charge it that night, and finally plugged it in right before bed the day after, at 1% left. I don't think I've ever gotten two full days out of a single charge on any of my iPhones in the past.</p><p>The physical form of the iPhone X<span class="small-caps">S</span> Max is nearly the same as the iPhone 8 Plus, but with a stainless steel band around the sides and an awesome edge-to-edge OLED display.</p><p>I picked up a Qi charger with my iPhone and use it to charge every night. It's a small thing, but it's nice to just rest the iPhone on my bedside table and it just starts charging. Sometimes it takes a little nudge to get lined up, but it emits a sound when it starts charging, so it doesn't bother me at all.</p><p>FaceID is great most of the time. I'm used to it now, but every so often I do wish I could unlock my phone without needing to point the phone towards my face. However, once the phone is unlocked I love how easy FaceID is. If I'm already using the phone, it authenticates me without requiring me to do anything. My favorite use of this is with the 1Password extension for entering passwords on websites and apps. All I need to do is tap the suggestion in the QuickType area above the keyboard and it automatically verifies my face and enters the username and password. I hope FaceID gets faster over time, I feel like I always have to wait for the animation to finish when authenticating myself in apps.</p><p>The iPhone X<span class="small-caps">S</span> now also has 4 GB of RAM, which will allow for better multi-tasking and more advanced applications that consume lots of memory.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion <a class="heading-link" href="#conclusion"><span class="sr-only">Permalink</span>#</a></h2><p>In short, <span aria-label="two thumbs up" class="emoji" role="img">👍👍</span>!</p><p>I'm happy with my decision to try the larger sized model of iPhone. I have to be more careful when holding it to minimize the risk of dropping it due to the larger size and weight, but it's important to protect your phone either way, right? While I never really thought my iPhone 7 was very slow, the six-core A12 Bionic is certainly much faster. I look forward to continuing to take even better photos with the much improved camera(s).</p></div><hr><footer><aside aria-labelledby="tagged-heading"><h2 id="tagged-heading">Tagged</h2><a
